PyRhO - A Virtual Optogenetics Laboratory
=========================================

A Python module to fit and characterise rhodopsin photocurrents

Optogenetics has become a key tool for understanding the function of neural circuits and controlling their behaviour. An array of directly light driven opsins have been genetically isolated from several families of organisms, with a wide range of temporal and spectral properties. In order to characterize, understand and apply these rhodopsins, we present an integrated suite of open-source, multi-scale computational tools called PyRhO. The purpose of developing PyRhO is threefold: (i) to characterize new (and existing) rhodopsins by automatically fitting a minimal set of experimental data to three, four or six-state kinetic models, (ii) to simulate these models at the channel, neuron \& network levels and (iii) provide functional insights through model selection and virtual experiments \emph{in silico}. The module is written in Python with an additional IPython/Jupyter notebook based GUI, allowing models to be fit, simulations to be run and results to be shared through simply interacting with a webpage. The seamless integration of model fitting algorithms with simulation environments for these virtual opsins will enable neuroscientists to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behaviour and rapidly identify the most suitable variant for application in a particular biological system. This process may thereby guide not only experimental design and opsin choice but also alterations of the rhodopsin genetic code in a neuro-engineering feed-back loop. In this way, we expect PyRhO will help to significantly improve optogenetics as a tool for transforming biological sciences.
